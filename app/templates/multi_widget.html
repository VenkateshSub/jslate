<div>The symbol widget_id surrounded by ${} will be replaced
	when the widget is added to the dashboard.  The replaced value is 
	in the form of 3_10 where 3 is the widget id and 10 is the dashboard id.
	This provides a unique id for this widget so it can be added to a dashboard
	more than once.  You will need to view source to see what I mean.
</div>
<div id="multi_widget_${widget_id}"></div>

<script type="text/javascript">

$(function()
{
	$('#multi_widget_${widget_id}').text("Hey");
});

</script>
